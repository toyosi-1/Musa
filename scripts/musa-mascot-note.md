# Musa Mascot Image Implementation

The user has provided a Musa mascot illustration to be used for:
1. Email templates (replacing the previous house icon design)
2. Favicon and app icons (replacing the current favicon)

## Action Items
1. Save the provided image as `/public/images/musa-mascot.png`
2. Create a new favicon from this image
3. Update all app icons referenced in manifest.json

## Instructions for Musa Team
The mascot image should be saved with proper transparency and optimized for web use.
For best results across email clients, the image should be:
- PNG format with transparency
- Approximately 400x400px for source file
- Clean edges and optimized for small sizes

## Email Integration
The updated email mascot component now references this image at:
`https://musa-security-app.windsurf.build/images/musa-mascot.png`

Please ensure the image is uploaded to this path on the production server.
